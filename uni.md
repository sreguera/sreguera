## Programación

I remember the professor holding a 5.25 floppy and saying "This is a diskette". It sounded silly at the moment but many people in the class didn't know what it was; most people didn't have a computer at home.

The programming language was Turbo Pascal. [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) 5 was an excellent language and development environment. The language was Pascal with packages (units), OOP support (since 5.5) and low level capabilities (remember the [asphyxia](http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/listed82.html?categoryid=130) tutorials?). The IDE was a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) with integrated help and debugger.

In the style of other books in the 90s, this one talks about the IDE, the language and its library, data structures and algorithms. The emphasis of this book is on the language part. I had chapter 2 in my course notes. [Link](https://www.mhe.es/universidad/informatica/8448150414/archivos/capitulo_2.pdf) to chapter 2 of a newer edition of the book.
